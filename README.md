# Dramatic.LivingDocumentation.DotDiagram
Hello, this is a quick and crude c# .NET port of LivingDocumentation DotDiagram, a Java library to create DOT diagrams

I am checking out the C4 architecture-as-code method by Simon Brown and found that his Structurizr java version contains a DotWriter that creates DOT diagrams for the workspace model.
The Structurizr DotWriter uses the Java library io.github.livingdocumentation.DotDiagram, and the C# version of Structurizr lacked both a DotWriter and a DotDiagram.

I ported the LivingDocumentation DotDiagram to C#, quick and dirty.
